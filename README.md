            Using this command, of course, you'll get started with your wonderful crawling experience.
            At the beginning, you will be asked for inserting the MAIN TAG.
            MAIN TAG could be anything - As long as Rule 34 exists.
            You can get started by searching Artist's / Character's Name, or A Category.

            Next, you will be asked for inserting some Additional Tag(s).
            This is an optional data, you can feel free to leave it empty, literally.
            Also, add a \"-\" could make your insert tag became A Negative Tag,
            you can use it when trying to disable the categories you don't like to see.

        -start -range:
            Using this command, you can add a range of your search result.
            If you want to start your search from page 1 to page 10, of course, 
            you will have to insert number "10" as the range.
```
